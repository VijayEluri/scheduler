To run:
  Navigate to the directory that contains scheduler.jar as well as the 'input' 
  folder.  Once there, use the jar to run the program (i.e. java -jar scheduler.jar).
  Command line argument details will be printed by the program.  
  
  Here is an example:
  
  java -jar --verbose input/1 FCFS
  
  Notice that the input files are named '1' through '7' for easy changes on the
  command line.
